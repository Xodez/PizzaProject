# PizzaProject

Pizza shop website where users can customize and order pizza. Users can create new and log in to existing accounts. 
The website would also remember what the user had in this basket. All this information was stored in an sqlite databse. 
The back end was built with javascript and nodehs runtime envoirement. 
Front end was just HTML and CSS.
